# Windermere

*Work In Progress*

## Big Wondermere Survey

The Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and Lancaster University kicked off a new citizen (community) science project on Windermere ([link](https://www.fba.org.uk/volunteer/the-big-windermere-survey)). 

### Spatial Hotspot analysis

Using the citizen collected data, this analysis will evaluate potential cold/hot spots in indicator parameters during the entire survey period and individual sampling events.
