## Big Windermere Survey

The Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and Lancaster University
kicked off a new citizen (community) science project on Windermere
([link](https://www.fba.org.uk/volunteer/the-big-windermere-survey)).

### Spatial Hotspot analysis

Using the citizen collected data, this analysis will evaluate potential
cold/hot spots in indicator parameters during the entire survey period
and individual sampling events.
